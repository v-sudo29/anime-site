      "text": "Warner Bros. Japan announced a new anime project for Buronson and Tetsuo Hara's Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star) manga on Wednesday, revealing a teaser visual (pictured). The new anime, titled Hokuto no Ken: Fist of the North Star, is celebrating the manga's 40th anniversary.\n\nBuronson and Hara serialized the action drama in Weekly Shounen Jump from 1983 to 1988 and compiled into 27 volumes. Shueisha later reprinted the series in 15 collector's edition volumes in 1991–1992 and 15 bunkoban volumes in 1997–1998. Hokuto no Ken has sold a cumulative 100 million copies of its volumes worldwide.\n\nToei Animation produced a television anime adaptation, which aired in 109 episodes from October 1984 to March 1987. A second season aired from March 1987 to February 1988, followed by a three-episode original video anime from July 2003 to May 2004.\n\nVIZ Media licensed the manga in English in October 2020 and shipped the ninth volume on June 27, with the tenth volume planned for a September 26 release.\n\nCoamix published the first two volumes of an 18-volume new edition on Wednesday. The third and fourth volume will go on sale on September 20, and subsequent volumes will be released on the 20th of each month.\n\nSynopsis\nIn 199x, the world was engulfed in the blaze of nuclear war.\n\nWith the Ocean drying up and Earth torn asunder, all life seems to be lost but humans survived stubbornly. However, what dominated the post-apocalyptic world was sheer violence. The remaining humanity was split into two groups: those who kill and take whatever they can and those who are exploited.\n\nWhen all hope seems lost for the weak, a man in ragged cloth appears. He is Kenshiro, the rightful successor of the Hokuto Shinken martial arts with seven studs-like scars in the shape of the Big Dipper. His journey to becoming a legendary savior begins!

He is Kenshiro, the rightful successor of the Hokuto Shinken martial arts with seven studs-like scars in the shape of the Big Dipper. His journey to becoming a legendary savior begins!
